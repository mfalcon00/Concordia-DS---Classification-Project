# Concordia-DS Classification-Project

This repository includes the files for the classification project required for the Concordia Bootcamp course.

For this project, we worked with a dataset containing information from a fictional telco company that provided home phone and internet services to 7043 customers in California during a quarter.
This dataset include multiple information about each customer, such as demographics, services used and whether the customer left or is still with the company. More information can be found : https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113

The goal of the project is to create a model to predict whether or not a customer will leave the company.

In this project we :
1. Analyzed the data (EDA)
2. Cleaned and prepared the data
3. Used 4 classification models
4. Decided on a final model
5. Make a prediction with new data
